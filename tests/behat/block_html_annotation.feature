Feature: When the ally filter is enabled ally annotations are inserted when appropriate into block_html content.

  Background:
    Given the ally filter is enabled
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category | format |
      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        | topics |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                |
      | student1 | Student   | 1        | student1@example.com |
      | teacher1 | Teacher   | 1        | teacher1@example.com |

      | user     | course | role           |

      | teacher1 | C1     | teacher        |

  @javascript
  Scenario Outline: Block html is annotated and following HTML content URL for annotation works.
    Given the following config values are set as admin:
      | theme | <theme> |
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I add a html block with title "Some block" and content "<p>Some content</p>"
    When I reload the page
    And I should see "Some content"
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And html block with title "Some block" is annotated
    And I log out
    And I log in as "student1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And html block with title "Some block" is annotated

  Examples:
  | theme |
  | clean |
  | boost |
  # Note - we could test for snap here too but if we did that it'd break the tests on non standard moodle installs.
