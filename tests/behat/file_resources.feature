@filter @filter_ally
Feature: When the ally filter is enabled ally place holders are inserted when appropriate into file resources.

  Background:
    Given the ally filter is enabled

  @javascript
  Scenario Outline: File resources are processed when viewed on a course page or a course section page.
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category | format |
      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        | topics |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                |
      | student1 | Student   | 1        | student1@example.com |
      | teacher1 | Teacher   | 1        | teacher1@example.com |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course   | role    |
      | student1 | <course> | student |
      | teacher1 | <course> | teacher |
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And <coursestep>
    And I allow guest access for current course
    And I create file resources using fixtures "test.doc, test.docx, test.odt, bpd_bikes_640px.jpg, testgif_small.gif, testpng_small.png" in section "<section>"
    When I reload the page
    Then I should see the feedback place holder for the "1st" file resource
    And I should see the feedback place holder for the "2nd" file resource
    And I should see the feedback place holder for the "3rd" file resource
    And I should see the feedback place holder for the "4th" file resource
    And I should see the feedback place holder for the "5th" file resource
    And I should see the feedback place holder for the "6th" file resource
    And I should see the download place holder for the "1st" file resource
    And I should see the download place holder for the "2nd" file resource
    And I should see the download place holder for the "3rd" file resource
    And I should see the download place holder for the "4th" file resource
    And I should see the download place holder for the "5th" file resource
    And I should see the download place holder for the "6th" file resource
    And I log out
    And I log in as "student1"
    When <coursestep>
    Then I should not see the feedback place holder for the "1st" file resource
    And I should not see the feedback place holder for the "2nd" file resource

    And I should see the download place holder for the "6th" file resource
    And I log out
    And I log in as "guest"
    When <coursestep>
    Then I should not see the feedback place holder for the "1st" file resource
    And I should not see the feedback place holder for the "2nd" file resource
    And I should not see the feedback place holder for the "3rd" file resource
